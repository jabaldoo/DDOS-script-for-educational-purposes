# DDOS Script for Educational Purposes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This script is intended strictly for **educational purposes** and to raise awareness about the potential impacts of Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. The use of this script against any system without proper authorization is **illegal** and may result in severe consequences. Always adhere to ethical guidelines and legal regulations when using or learning about such tools.

## üöÄ About This Project

This repository provides a basic script demonstrating how a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack can be simulated. Its purpose is to educate users on the mechanics of such attacks and to emphasize the importance of proper cybersecurity measures to mitigate them.

---

## üìã Features

- Simulates a DDOS attack for educational environments
- Demonstrates basic networking concepts and traffic generation
- Helps users understand attack detection and mitigation strategies

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The script generates a high volume of traffic aimed at a target server or IP address, mimicking a real-world DDOS scenario. By studying this behavior in a controlled environment, users can learn:

- How DDOS attacks overwhelm network resources
- Methods to detect unusual traffic patterns
- Best practices for securing servers against such threats
