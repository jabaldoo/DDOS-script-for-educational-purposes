# DDOS Script for Educational Purposes

This is a simple Python script designed to simulate a **Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS)** attack for **educational purposes only**. It demonstrates how a basic DDOS attack works by sending multiple TCP connections to a target IP and port.

**Disclaimer**: This script is intended for educational and ethical use only. Do not use it for illegal or malicious activities. The author is not responsible for any misuse of this script.
